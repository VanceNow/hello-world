# hello-world
Testing Github

I'm pretty new to writing code. I've been a musician and server for a good chunk of my 20's, and have been happy to work, save, travel, and repeat. Given the state of the world and the fact that my 30th birthday is right around the corner, I've considered the possibility that my current carreer path isn't as durable or rewarding as I had hoped. I'm basically trying to make up for lost time and to develop skills that will afford me some more flixibility in an uncertain time. To boot, I have plenty of time on my hands and am actually enjoying the process of learning to code. It's has required a long overdue self-discipline, and a different mode of thinking. I like changning. I'm a glutton for punishment. I'm hoping that within threee years, I'll no longer be serving and I'll maybe even have health  and dental insurance! Wishful thinking, maybe. I'm hoping at the very least that I can cobble together a more sustainable living with a broader set of skills. Maybe someday I'll be able to design and build something of use to someone. I dream of making an interactive agricultural planning application geared toward urban spaces.
